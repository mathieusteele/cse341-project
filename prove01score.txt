After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github. You do not have to worry about pushing to Heroku this lesson.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):

    https://github.com/mathieusteele/cse341-project

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 

    The base route "/" works and has the form as expected. I also added a hyperlink to the users route. After a form submission is received, the users route will include it in the list of users whose names are displayed.   

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

    N/A

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.

    I learned the array.push in one route can affect the the array on the server in a way that it can be read from in the other route.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?

    I learned a lot this week and I felt that the assignment was just about right.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

   I feel I at least met the requirements and tried to excel to achieve a 5.

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

    I experimented with using an array to hold the usernames and map over them before I saw that this was the expected pattern from the ta01 file. I was trying to think of how the data might be coming from a data store of some kind and how that store would need to be updated with the form submissions.
